-ABOUT ME:
Hi there! I'm Aarti, a data analyst by day and a coffee connoisseur by night. When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me sipping on a cup of coffee and brainstorming my next project.

I'm a self-proclaimed Excel ninja and SQL samurai. My coding skills are sharper than a freshly brewed espresso shot, and my attention to detail is as strong as a triple-shot latte.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and binge-watching the latest Netflix series. I like to think of myself as a data analyst by day, chef by night, and couch potato on the weekends.

I'm always up for a challenge, whether it's tackling a complex data problem or trying to brew the perfect cup of coffee. So, let's grab a cup of joe and dive into some data!
